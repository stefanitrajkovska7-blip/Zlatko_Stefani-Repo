Decisions AS I go to anywhere I flow
decisions as I go to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times
I CAN fly high, I can go low
Today I got a million, tomorrow I don't know.
It's WRITTEN in our stories, it's written on the walls
Dancing in the moonlight, don't we have it all?
It's written in our stories, it's written on the walls
